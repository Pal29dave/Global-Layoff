SQL Data Cleaning Project – Global Layoffs
End‑to‑end SQL data‑cleaning project on a global layoffs dataset, turning messy raw data into an analytics‑ready table.

What This Project Does
Creates a safe staging layer so the raw layoffs table is never touched.

Removes duplicate records using window functions to keep only unique rows.

Standardizes industries, countries, and dates into consistent formats.

Handles blanks and nulls smartly (convert blanks to NULL, selectively impute, keep meaningful nulls).

Drops rows and columns that add no analytical value to streamline reporting.

Why It’s Valuable
Shows ability to design a clear SQL‑based data‑cleaning blueprint end to end.

Uses advanced SQL (window functions, self‑joins, staged deletes) on real‑world‑style messy data.

Produces a clean, trustworthy dataset ready for dashboards and executive‑level analysis.
